AirOptima introduces an innovative approach to enhance runway and taxiway
management using advanced sensor technology and real-time data processing:

Real-Time Data Fusion Hub: This central system integrates data from various
sources, including photonic sensors and multi-spectral cameras, alongside existing
systems like radar and LIDAR. It provides a comprehensive and real-time overview of
runway and taxiway conditions.

AI-Driven Predictive Modeling: Our AI algorithms analyze both historical and real- time data to predict potential hazards and congestion. This allows for proactive
adjustments in runway usage and taxiway routing, improving safety and optimizing
trafficÂ flow.
